# Tasks

Markdown for quick notes on issues to fix after a first read through of the code.

## HTML

[x] script tag should to have `defer` in it so the JS loading doesn't cause issue for the HTML.
[ ] Header, main, body and footer tags would be helpful semantic elements. `EX: first div tag should be a header.`
[ ] All h1 headings. Main heading should be h1 but the following `sub-headers should be downsized accordingly.`
[ ] Ensure `image and alt text` are edited to working order. Currently empty.
[ ] Check out divs at bottom of page (there just seem to be a lot...?) -Look for tags that are not closed and that things are properly nested.
[ ] Use validator to help with syntax errors.

## CSS

[ ] `header h0` is being targeted on `line 27 and 142`... this does not exist.
[ ] Check: Places where `clamp` could be replaced/inserted. -Check: Flexibility of the page at different sizes.
[ ] Check: What does `:last child` mean/do?
[ ] General proof-read for any typos
[ ] Browser inspector`(?)` for visibility issues.
[ ] Should we be using all one value of measurement? `IE: All rem or all pixels`... Something to google.
[ ] ul li:hover {transform: translateX(4px);}. `translateX` is a new one for me. Something to google.

## JavaScript

[x] no `","` after Skywalker.
[ ] Other simple syntax issues?
[ ] Check: Browser console!!!
