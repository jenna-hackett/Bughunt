Quick notes for issues to fix after first read through of code.

## HTML

[ ] script tag should to have "defer" in it so the JS loading doesn't cause issue for the HTML.
[ ] header, main, body and footer tags would be helpful semantic elements. EX: first div tag should be a header.
[ ] All h1. Main heading should be h1 but the following sub-headers should be downsized accordingly.
[ ] ensure image and alt text are edited to working order.
[ ] fix all the divs at the end of the page.

## CSS

[ ] header h0(???) on line 27 and 142
[ ] Check for places where clamp could be replaced/inserted.
